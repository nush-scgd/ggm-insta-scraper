# GGM Insta Scraper

This project helps identify and collect Instagram profiles of small U.S.-based businesses—especially Shark Tank-style startups—with products manufactured overseas (e.g., China, India, Vietnam).

## 💡 Purpose
To support Go Get MADE in building an outreach list of potential product partners or trendsetters who may benefit from manufacturing and marketing support.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- `googlesearch-python` for result scraping
- `pandas` and `openpyxl` for Excel export
- Streamlit (optional) for GUI

## 📁 Output
- `scraped_instagram_links.xlsx`: a spreadsheet with all matched profiles and query terms

## ✅ Future Plans
- Frontend interface for Eric (via Streamlit)
- Optional business enrichment (bio, contact info, followers)
- Export to Google Sheets or Dropbox (free APIs)
